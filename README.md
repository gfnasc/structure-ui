Structure-UI is a Vue 3 component library designed from the ground up with a laser focus on **Core Web Vitals**, **SEO**, and an **excellent developer experience**. It's built with TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS, and bundled with Vite for maximum efficiency and minimal bundle size.

## ✨ Core Principles

Our development is guided by three main pillars:

### 🏎️ 1. Performance
We are obsessed with building components that are blazing fast and lightweight. This is achieved through:
-   **LCP and CLS Optimization:** Ensuring a smooth and stable loading experience.
-   **JavaScript Minimalism:** Components are designed to be as lightweight as possible, with interactivity added on an opt-in basis.
-   **Efficient Bundling:** Leveraging Vite and Rollup for effective tree-shaking, so you only ship the code you use.

### 📦 2. Modularity
Structure-UI is designed to be fully modular. You can import and use only the specific components and composables you need, keeping your application lean and mean.

### 🔌 3. Nuxt Integration
We provide a seamless, zero-configuration integration with Nuxt.js, making it incredibly easy to use Structure-UI in your Nuxt projects.
